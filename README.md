# Imbalanced Dataset Handling Techniques in Data Science

## Description
This notebook is an educational resource aimed at understanding and handling imbalanced datasets, a frequent challenge in data science with significant implications in areas such as fraud detection. Beginners often face datasets where one class significantly outnumbers another, leading to misleading high accuracy scores due to elevated false positive rates.

To address these challenges, the notebook explores a variety of sampling techniques designed to balance class distribution, thereby enhancing the reliability and interpretability of model performance.

## Sampling Techniques Covered
- **Random Under Sampling**: Reduces the number of instances from the majority class.
- **Near Miss Under Sampling**: Selects majority class instances based on their proximity to minority class instances.
- **Tomek Links Under Sampling**: Removes Tomek Links, which are pairs of close, opposite-class instances.
- **Cluster Centroids Under Sampling**: Creates representative samples by clustering the majority class.
- **Random Over Sampling**: Duplicates instances in the minority class to increase their number.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority OverSampling Technique)**: Generates synthetic instances of the minority class.
- **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Over Sampling)**: Focuses on generating samples near hard-to-classify instances, similar to SMOTE.
- **SMOTE & Tomek Links**: A combination of over and under sampling for a balanced approach.

## Case Study: Credit Card Fraud Detection
The notebook includes a case study on Credit Card Fraud Detection to demonstrate the application of these techniques. A comparative analysis provides insights into how each method affects model performance, particularly in terms of accuracy and false positive rates.

## Importance
This comprehensive analysis is invaluable for beginners and experienced practitioners, offering practical knowledge in effectively tackling imbalanced datasets.
